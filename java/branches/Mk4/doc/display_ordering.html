<h1>Ordering Display Elements Using Visitors</h1>
<p>One of the most critical elements of developing the display branch of a game is ensuring that
all of sprites, background, and other visual elements get displayed correctly. What can be especially
odious to debug is incorrect display order: When a element meant to be displayed "lower" is instead 
drawn on top, or vice versa.</p>
<p>There are a number of strategies for ensuring that this doesn't happen, ranging from having a fixed
order list of things being displayed, to iteratively querying a set to determine the next element to
draw, but one method that is extremely easy to implement for AGE games is a composite display visitor.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Background: How does it work?</h3>
<p>If you think about very simple games there really wouldn't be much need to have more than one 
display class: All the elements occupy a unique space on the drawing surface and will simply be 
drawn in place when they need to be displayed. But problems arise if you need to layer things.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to draw tiles of terrain underneath unit sprites: If all of nodes for the
terrain and the units are sibblings, and the units and terrain can overlap, how do you make sure that
the units appear on top of the terrain? You can make the units children of one node and the terrain
children of another node, then order those nodes so that the terrain is drawn first. You can order
all the children of the parent node so that terrain is always inserted before sprites. Most of these
are architectural solutions that follow a format of ensuring that lower batches are processed before 
higher batches.</p>
<p>These approaches can work surprisingly well provided the way that things are set up is strictly 
enforced. This in itself can lead to problems; often there are different code paths for setting up a 
new game verses a saved game, for instance, and both paths would need to result in identical outputs.</p>
<p>These approaches also have the disadvantage that they often require special setup code that must
be maintained and extended to ensure new features don't break the display graph.</p>
<p>AGE allows for a different approach to this problem.</p>
<p>Instead of using the architecture of the game graph to dictate the order things are processed the
display order is set using different display visitors and a tourguide. Each displayable object gets 
a different display class (they can be functionally identical, they just have to different classes),
and each of these classes is marked with <code>@DecoragtesFor</code> annotation, pointing to a 
superclass. Each of these classes has a corresponding visitor class which are bundled into a <code>
Tourguide</code> in the order you want the elements displayed. By providing one extra display visitor
that keys off of the super class for the display classes as the leader class for the tour guide, you
effectively ensure that all of your display graph will be displayed in the correct order.</p>
<p/>
<p>Ok, what's going on may not be immediately obvious, so let's walk through the steps that will 
happen during the display branch of a game turn (note: we'll be assuming that we're making heavy
use of existing engine features):
<ol>
	<li>First, we start with the <code>GameLoop.assessUpdate(Node)</code> call. This call uses the 
	overall tourguide to traverse the node hierarchy.</li>
	<li>For each node, the <code>Node.accept(Visitor)</code> method is called. On the <code>
	DefaultNode</code> this means cascading through all of the node's children calling <code>
	accept</code> as well.
	<li>Each node calls <code>Visitor.isInView(Node)</code>, passing itself in as the argument. If
	the visitor can process them it returns <code>true</code>.</li>
	<li>Since a <code>Tourguide</code> doesn't process nodes itself,  it hands this code off to the
	leader of the Tourguide class. If the leader can visit, so do all the visitors in the
	<code>Tourguide</code>.</li>
	<li>When <code>Visitor.isInView(Node)</code> returns <code>true</code> the Node knows that it can
	accept the visitor, and subsequently calls the <code>Tourguide's visit(Node)</code>
	method, again, passing itself as the argument.</li>
	<li>The Tourguide then iterates through it's visitors calling the visit method for each one in
	turn with the node. If the node has the correct <code>Decorator</code> class for the visitor,
	and the decorator returns <code>true</code> when the <code>Decorator.needsUpdate()</code> 
	and <code>Decorator.isInView(D)</code> methods are called the node is added to that visitor's
	"needsUpdate" list.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point people already familiar with the guts of AGE are probably nodding off. But this is
the point at which things get really interesting, because it's at this point you should realize that
a Tourguide is a subclass of Visitor, which means Tourguides can have Tourguides in their array of
Visitors.</p>
<p>Why does this make a difference? Let's continue:</p>
<ol start="7">
	<li>If your display visitor is, in fact, a <code>Tourguide</code> guiding two or more display
	visitors, consider what happens when visit is called.<br>
	Each display visitor is called with the node, and each looks for it's own decorator.<br>
	If that decorator is found, then that node is added to that visitor's "needsUpdate" list.<br>
	Now, you've effectively split your display graph into different "bins" by letting the visitor
	mechanism sort for you. Note that you've also done it in linear time.</li>
	<li>Now, the next thing that happens is that this sorting sticks around till <code>
	GameLoop.render()</code> is called. At that point the display decorator (which for our purposes is
	a Tourguide with our display decorators in it) has it's <code>Visitor.process()</code> method
	called. This method iterates through the needsUpdate list and calls <code>
	Visitor.update(Decorator)</code> on each decorator it's collected. The update code is
	typically where the bulk of the work is actually done.</li>
	<li>In our case, that Visitor is actually a <code>Tourguide</code>. When it's <code>process()
	</code> method is called, it will iterate over the <code>Visitors</code> in it's internal list 
	and call each of their <code>process()</code> methods, <b>in the order the that the Visitors
	were supplied in the constructor.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>This means that if you place the terrain visitor in the tourguide first, all the terrain will be
drawn first. If you place the unit visitor second, all the units will get displayed second; after
all the terrain has already been drawn.</p>
<p>As always there are a few gotchas for doing this. If you're subclassing <code>
AWTGraphicsVisitor</code> be aware that it's <code>startProcess()</code> and <code>finishProcess()
</code> methods will clear and blit the screen respectively. You don't want that for each display 
decorator, so you'll want to make sure that only the first one clears and only the last one blits.</p>
