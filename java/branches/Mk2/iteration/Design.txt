-Positioning-
Each child should be arranged with an offset from their parent. When the parent is moved all children, subsequently, move. There
need to be methods for determining absolute position of children quickly for purposes of culling. 

-Culling-
Culling is best done top-down: Given an area or volume start at the root node and weed out all the nodes that are children that
do not intersect, recursively. This gives you a list of all nodes that should receive messages. The easiest way to do this
is to have nodes determine if they themselves are on screen, given the area. But, since children have locations relative to their
parents, it may be more effective to have the "area" determine what's inside it.

-Collision-
With a culled set of nodes it should be easy to determine which are capable of collision interaction. From there the method must 
be a reduction interaction, i.e. the first node is tested against the rest of the list complete, the second against all starting 
with the third, etc....
