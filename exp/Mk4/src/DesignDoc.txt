CullingVisitor visits a node and determines if it needs to update. If it does the node first
passes the culling visitor to its children for update. If it has no children, or has already
iterated them, the node looks at the update package to see what visitors are inside. Each 
visitor pulls out the applicable decorator and asks it if it needs an update. If it does, 
the visitor updates it.
