<h1>AGE Framework Overview</h1>
<hr>
<h3>GameLoop</h3>
<p>The AGE framework starts with one class: GameLoop. GameLoop is, fundamentally, the only actual class
in the AGE framework (the rest being interfaces). Within GameLoop is a lot of logic for making sure
that the game is running at a reasonable clip and there are methods for setting and getting sound,
logic, culling, and display visitors (more on these shortly).</p>
<p>The constructor for the GameLoop takes only one argument: The root Node. Nodes represent all the
interactive parts of the game (more on them shortly too).</p>
<p>Sneakly codified in this architecture is one
of the most salient parts of the AGE: Nodes contain and organize the data into a hierarchy that makes
it easy to process, visitors contain the machinery to actually process the data and drive the 
mechanics of the game itself</p>
<h5>Distribution of Responsibility</h5>
<p>One of the key tenets of AGE is that each interface should define one job that it needs to do.
The Node interface, for example, defines only those methods that are necessary for a class to work
as a Node. Visitor defines only methods that are necessary for a class to function as a visitor. In
this way we avoid having classes that define methods that they will never use. Likewise, it means that
game writers only ever have to define methods for those aspects they want their classes to use.</p>
<p>Due to this philosophy, GameLoop doesn't actually do any processing itself. It does the bare 
minimum required to fulfill it's job as a GameLoop: It calls on the Visitors (which do the actual
processing) to process the hierarchy of the root Node, and based on how long it takes those processes
to complete, it attempts to ensure that the update period is kept to a certain speed.</p>
<h3>Nodes, and the Node Hierarchy</h3>
<p>The data structure of AGE is a Node tree: The root node contains a number of children, all of which 
can contain their own children. Nodes themselves contain a data member that defines what they represent:
Attributes. Attributes itself is merely an interface that defines a clone method, but it represents
an area where game writers can implement their own representation of the data they need to build the 
game that they want without having to conform any pre-existing data types.</p>
<p>Nodes also have methods for getting both specific Decorators or the bare-undecorated Node (this is
important because Decorators themselves extend node, and you need to be able to drill down to the 
actual data representation if you've chained a lot of decorators together), as well as methods for
finding the parent or finding/manipulating children of the node, and methods to determine if the
this node can accept a certain visitor or is being decorated by a given decorator.</p>
<h3>Visitors and Decorators</h3>
<p>Visitors and Decorators form two sides of a contract. Visitors stipulate that an action will be
performed on the Node, provided it is decorated by a given Decorator, and Decorators guarantee
that then Node that they decorate contains all the information necessary for the Visitor to do it's
job.</p>
<p>For people who are unfamiliar with the Visitor design pattern, Visitors rely on a concept called 
Double Dispatch, where in the Visitor calls a method on the element in question and asks it if it 
can accept the Visitor. If it can then the element itself calls the "visit" method of the visitor.</p>
<p>In this case, Visitors start at the root Node and call accept passing themselves as an argument.
If the Node itself makes one call back to the Visitor first: A call to determine if it is in the 
Visitor's "view" (i.e. it determines if it is going to be something that is within the scope of this
update, which usually means that it's something on the screen). If that call passes, then the node
iterates over any children that it has calling accept on them and passing them the Visitor. Once it's 
children are done updating, the Node itself calls the Visitor's visit method.</p>
<p>The Visitor then looks for the Decorator that it needs in order to proceed on the Node. If it
finds it then Visitor asks if the Node needs to be updated. If it does, it gets placed in an update
queue.</p>
<p>The reason that the Nodes get placed in a queue and not processed immediately is a question of 
time: Because certain operations (like display) take longer than others (like logic), and a certain
framerate needs to be achieved, it can become necessary to skip one or two frames (hopefully not more)
of display in order to keep the game running smoothly. This leads to two different approaches toward
achieving this (given our model). The first is to call each Visitor to visit the whole hierarchy 
in turn, leaving off those that take too long till the next frame.</p>
<p>This can cause problems because it means that certain operations may never be called if the game
is running slowly. But, more importantly, it wastes time rewalking the Node hierarchy with each
Visitor, which, with a big enough Node tree, can be very expensive.</p>
<p>The second approach is what we've termed the "Tourguide". The Tourguide class is a Visitor that 
wraps a collection of other Visitors, using one Visitor as the "Leader". Generally speaking, the
Leader is the Visitor that performs the culling operation, or more succinctly, the Visitor that
determines what is being shown on screen.</p>
<p>The Tourguide ensures that you walk the Node hierarchy only once, with the Tourguide standing in 
for all the other Visitors during the accept operation. The Tourguide hands the Node first to the
Leader, to determine if it should hand it to the other Visitors, then to the remaining Visitors 
to get evaluated for all the other aspects.</p>
<p>In this way the hierarchy gets walked only once, and all the Nodes that need to be updated are found.
At this point, once all the elements that need to be updated have been identified, the list of Nodes
that needed a particular type of update can be processed by the Visitor's process method, which 
iterates over the list of Nodes that the Visitor previously made and updates them.</p>
<p>Another advantage of processing after doing the visiting is that any expensive operations that need
to be performed, or special setup that needs to be done (like setting up double buffering), can be
done only after all the elements that will be updated are known. Likewise, if special teardown needs
to be done, it can wait till after all the elements have been identified (and processed).</p>
<h3>The Gist of the Framework</h3>
<p>At this point the groundwork for the Framework has been laid out. If you look at it there really isn't
a lot of code behind it at this level: There's a GameLoop, which expects a root Node and some
Decorators and Visitors, and the Tourguide, but not much else. But this is intentional: Although 
the GameLoop does have methods for getting and setting elements called DisplayVisitor, SoundVisitor,
etc... no real assumption is made about their content.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if multiple forms of display are needed, for example, since the setDisplayVisitor 
method on the GameLoop just takes a Visitor, a Tourguide with multiple display Visitors could be 
substituted. Where you take it from here is entirely up to you.</p>
<p>However, as frameworks go, this is a little light, and there are plenty of other classes left to
introduce.</p>
